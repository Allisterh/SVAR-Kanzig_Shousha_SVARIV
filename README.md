# Kanzig_Shousha_SVARIV
Project of estimation effects of shocks from Shousha (2016) by external instrument from Känzig (2021)

1) Estimating Surprice Series as in Känzig (2021)
2) Estimating SVAR with external instrument (our Surprice Series)
3) Estimating SVAR with Cholesky decomposition and MA representation (recursive method)
4) Estimating ordinary VAR(p)
5) Perform a Wald test and F-test to determine the strength of the instrument
6) Plotting IRFs and CI for Plug-in estimator and Anderson-Rubin set (José L. Montiel Olea, James H. Stock, Mark W. Watson; 2021)
7) Make (2-6) for data used in Shousha (2016) with (1) - external instrument from Känzig (2021)
8) Compare the results
 
Code uses SVAR-IV module 
https://github.com/MaxLugo/SVARIV

Code uses Local Projections by elenev 
https://github.com/elenev/localprojections/blob/master/localprojections.py

<br>

Graphs and plots are my replications of graphs from Sousha(2016) and Känzig (2021)
<br>

Data may differ due to  my choice of sources

For future work:

1) Perform Local Projections estimation and IRFs for this method (done)
   
3) ....
